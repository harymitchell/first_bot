IMPORTANT
In order to run this application successfully there are a few important steps you must take!

1) Cert: You must access the application over HTTPS and accept my security certificate!
2) Auth: Whatever Google account you use to login my app, it must be linked to a YouTube account! 
3) Auth: In order for the OAUTH to succesfully verify the key, you must turn on/unblock all cookies!
